# Rent-It



Team project for CSE 110 (Software Engineering), Winter 2016, at the Univeristy of California, San Diego.



Rent-It is a Craigslist-style Android app that is used for renting items posted by other users, as well as posting items yourself. It supports profile creation, login, posting, searching, and favoriting functionality. For security purposes, actual rental and money-exchanging functionality has not been implemented.



Built with Android Studio utilizing a Firebase back-end.
